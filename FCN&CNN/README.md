### Self-Learn
- From [a mini assignment](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/assignment3.html)
- challenging to detailed FCN&CNN implementation

- `convolutional_network.ipynb`:

    - with speed-up vector implementation
    - `.py` implementation is hidden
    - section `Convolutional nets with batch normalization`:
    - Possible Issues (acceptable): reg = 0, maximum errors of `b` in first L-1 layers
